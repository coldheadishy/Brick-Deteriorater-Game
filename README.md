Slowly deteriorate the large brick at the top of the screen, one ball to do this. Score is computed based on how much of the brick is broken before losing the ball. It's kept up by using a small platform, which you can move laterally left to right with arrow keys. The ball will make contact with the platform and deflect given the platform is correctly positioned. If you miss and do not manage to deflect the ball, the game ends.

Controls:
Left arrow key – the platform moves left.
Right arrow key – the platform moves right.
Hold down either one to send the platform in that direction perpetually.
Click anywhere on the screen to end the game.
