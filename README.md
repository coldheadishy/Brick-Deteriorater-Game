Game Description: 
In Brick Breaker your objective is to slowly deteriorate the large brick at the top of the screen, the catch is you have one ball to do this. Your score is determined by how much of the brick you manage to break before losing your ball. You will keep it up by using a small platform, which you can move laterally left to right with the left and right keyboard keys. The ball will make contact with the platform and deflect, your job is to position the platform correctly so that when the ball comes down far enough the platform is ready to catch it and throw it back in the opposite direction. If you miss and do not manage to deflect the ball, the game ends.
